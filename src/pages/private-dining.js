        At Butcher’s Cut, our private wine cellar seats up to forty people
        comfortably with the luxury of at-table service and an in-house
        Sommelier. Our sommelier hand-selects wines from our notable wine list
        that compliments each dish seamlessly. With our Wine Cellar you get your
        own exclusive space that has a relaxing, romantic, vintage atmosphere.
        The walls are draped with authentic, black and white butcher paintings
        that will take you back to a simpler time. We offer a chef’s pick,
        seasonal, pre-set menu for larger parties or a la carte as well. We
        invite you to treat your staff or family and friends to a dining
        experience you will cherish forever at the newest and trendiest
        restaurant in all of the Gaslamp District.
